## Summary of Findings


In the exploration phase I found majority of borrowers are employed and the highest count of prosper rating is 'A',
while the most frequent rating for the defaulted loans is E and The most frequent rating in the completed loans is AA.
The highest number of loans are from the Debt Consolidation and least in from the Auto.
The data shows the the defaulted loans are larger in the amount than the completed loans 
and The highest income is directly related to prosper rating AA and the lowest is HR then E.
Finally, AA rating seems to have higher defaulted loans even thogh they have the highest income.



## Key Insights for Presentation

I have chosen some major factors to present in a univariate, bivariate and multivariate visualizations.
first I have plotted the Loan status and employment status as a bar plot and the stated monthly income as a histogram.
secondly, I plotted the Loan Status vs Loan Amount as a box plot, Loan Status vs Prosper Rating. 
Finally, in the multivariate phase I plotted the relationship between using barplot and (Prosper Rating, Loan Amount and Loan Status) 
in barplots as well. Finally, I used Facetgrid to visualize (Listing Categories, Prosper Rating and Loan Status)
